/*Threads – Part A (Thread Creation and Lifecycle)
Topic: Creating and Managing Threads
Objective: To demonstrate thread creation using Thread class and Runnable interface.
Problem Statement:
Write a Java program to:
1. Create threads by extending the Thread class.
2. Use methods like start(), sleep(), join(), and interrupt() to control thread 
execution.
Concepts Covered: Thread Class, Thread Lifecycle, Thread Control
